# Data-analysis-and-visualization-projects
This is a data analysis and visualization project that I created to showcase my skills in this field. Using Jupyter Notebook and various Python libraries, I analyzed a dataset of employee attrition rate and visualized the results using tables and various different types of charts.

Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I also gained experience in using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis and create visualizations.

This project highlights my ability to work independently and to apply my analytical skills to real-world data. I am excited to continue developing my skills in data analysis and visualization and to contribute to the success of a team.
